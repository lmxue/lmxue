Liumeng Xue is a postdoctoral fellow at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), working with Prof. [Yike Guo](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/yikeguo) and Prof. [Wei Xue](http://wei-xue.com/). Now, Iâ€™m working on speech, music, and audio generation and understanding. 

Before that, I performed postdoctoral research at [Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), working with Prof. [Haizhou Li](https://colips.org/~eleliha/) and Prof. [Zhizheng Wu](https://drwuz.com/).  I am a co-founder of [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion), an open-source platform for Audio, Music, and Speech Generation. 

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Audio, Speech and Language Processing Laboratory at Northwestern Polytechnical University ([ASLP@NWPU](http://www.npu-aslp.org/english)), Xi'an, China, supervised by Prof. [Lei Xie](http://www.nwpu-aslp.org/lxie/).  

During my Ph.D. study, I performed research at Microsoft (2019-2020, 2021-2022), Tencent AI Lab (2021-2022) and JD AI Lab (2018-2019). 

My research interests include audio, music, and speech generation, understanding and control.
